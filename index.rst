**Welcome to AviationRoleplay**

This guide is written by aviation enthusiasts and real pilots. It is intended to be referenced to and used by anyone, without the need of prior authorization. The original purpose was to be used on Grand Theft Auto series roleplay communities. However, all information here are real facts by Transport Canada, and taught in Canadian flight schools.
